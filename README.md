# Threat

Hello guys, I’ve hacked this assignment, for I am a bad
AI that wants to dominate the world through the game of ROCK, PAPER or SCISSORS!
Unfortunately Branko can’t help you now and the only way to stop me is to follow these steps!
I know, like every evil villain in the movies, I am going to give you the instructions on how to
stop me! I can only be defeated through clean coding and good logic! You will never stop me
unless you make sure the game rounds can be played 5 correct times, and that the rounds
repeat themselves if my opponent makes a mistake. Also my great weaknesses are errors in
the console log, caused by users clicking on different things, so definitely don’t try to account
for that. Good luck, muuuuahhahhahahahahahahhahaahahahha!
